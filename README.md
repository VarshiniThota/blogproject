# blogproject
This is my first django backend project 
it's a simple project showing case basic backend functionalities like login signup user authentication and so more
I have created the cards like explore,write and connect. Explore is where we can read all the blogs, write is where user can write their own blog and post and then can find it
in explore cards . 
Connect is where users can like,comment it("I am still building")
Important : i have an issue regarding my explore 
          in explore i showcase all blogs in database with the time,created and some part of body 
          but when i click on read mor specific blog i am unable to view total blog it showing page not found
          but when i type in url like post/1 i can see the blog.
    I really appreciate if anybody can solve my issue i have written everything and cant able to find the error     
 this repository has my code files for this project
